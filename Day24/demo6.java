2. Banking Systems:

A Java-based application designed to handle core banking operations such as 
managing customer accounts, processing transactions, and handling loan 
applications. The system leverages Java collections for efficient data 
storage and retrieval.

Features and Modules:

1. **Customer Account Management**:
   - Create, update, and delete customer accounts.
   - Store customer details, including name, contact information, address, 
     account type (savings, current, etc.), and account balance.
   - Assign unique account numbers to each customer.

2. **Transactions**:
   - Enable deposit, withdrawal, and fund transfer operations.
   - Track transaction history for each account with timestamps, amounts, and 
     transaction types.
   - Validate transactions for sufficient balance and other constraints.

3. **Loan Management**:
   - Allow customers to apply for loans, such as personal, home, or auto loans.
   - Maintain loan details, including loan amount, interest rate, tenure, 
     and repayment schedules.
   - Automate EMI (Equated Monthly Installments) calculations and tracking.

4. **Balance Inquiry and Mini Statements**:
   - Provide customers with real-time balance updates.
   - Generate mini statements showing recent transactions.

5. **Account Security**:
   - Implement secure login for customers and administrators.
   - Encrypt sensitive data, such as passwords and account details.
   - Include two-factor authentication for added security.

6. **Interest Calculation**:
   - Automate interest calculations for savings accounts based on rates and 
     account balance.
   - Update account balances periodically to reflect earned interest.

7. **Reporting and Analytics**:
   - Generate detailed reports on customer accounts, transactions, and loans.
   - Provide insights into financial trends for decision-making.

Technology Stack:
- Core Java
- Opps Concepts
- Collection Framework
- Java Built-In methods

Example Implementation Steps:
- Step 1: Design the database schema with tables like Customers, Accounts, 
  Transactions, and Loans.
- Step 2: Implement user authentication and session management.
- Step 3: Develop features for account and transaction management using 
  Java collections.
- Step 4: Build loan management and interest calculation modules.
- Step 5: Add reporting and analytics tools for administrators.

Scalability and Security:
- Ensure the system can handle multiple concurrent users and high transaction 
  volumes.
- Protect sensitive data using encryption and secure coding practices.

Objective:
To provide a robust and secure platform for banking operations, offering 
customers a seamless banking experience while streamlining administrative 
tasks for the bank.
